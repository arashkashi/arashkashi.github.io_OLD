      <h1>Arash Kashi</h1>
      <h2>iOS Freelancer - Swift & Objective-C</h2>
    </div>
    <div id='hello'>
      <p>I am an experienced (4+ years) Swift and Objective-C developer based
        in Berlin, Germany.</p>
      <p>I have worked in various domains as software developer including
        <a href="https://www.trusimulation.com">aerospace<a>,
          <a href="https://www.wooga.com">entertainment and gaming</a>, and
          <a href="https://www.feingoldtech.net/en/">healthcare</a> in the
          past 10 years.</p>
      <p>As a computer science graduate I have enthusiasm for programming
        languages and enjoy attending community gatherings such as
        <a href="http://swift.berlin/swift-berlin-24/">swift.berlin</a>.</p>
      <p>I have also worked on some successful mobile apps and am well aware
        of some key factors needed to get from an idea to App store and maintain
         its success. In <a href="https://www.wooga.com">Wooga</a> I worked on
         <a href="https://www.wooga.com/games/diamond-dash/">Diamond Dash</a>
          where I experienced with customized UI and social network integration. In My
           other experience at <a href="https://www.feingoldtech.net/en/">Feingold</a>/<a href="https://www.sharecare.com">Sharecare</a> a child company of
           <a href="https://www.webmd.com">WebMD</a> I worked on a B2B data
           intensive health app for data collection and tailored health content.</p>
      <p>If you want to take a look into my coding style, I have made one of my early
        swift projects namely <a href="https://github.com/arashkashi/sunflower">Lafro</a>, open source. Lafro allows you to memorize
        first 1500 most commonly used German words collected from subtitles of hundred of real movies.</P>
      <p>Currently as an independent developer I am looking for new clients
        who would like to build their early stage product and MVPs, or simply
        have a running app and would like to add features or improve. Please
        take note of my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arashkashi/">LinkedIn profile</a> and If you think we would be a good
        match working together I would be glad to hear more about you and your
        project via my <a href="mailto:arashkashi@gmail.com?subject=iOS project">email.</a> </P>
